# AnchorJS

AnchorJS is a JavaScript library that automatically adds deep anchor links to headings (h2, h3, etc.) in your content. This improves navigation and shareability for long-form documentation and articles.

## Category

## Usage

- It automatically adds anchor links to all `h2` and `h3` elements after each page navigation.
- No manual import is needed in components.

## Accessibility

- Anchor links are keyboard and screen reader accessible.
