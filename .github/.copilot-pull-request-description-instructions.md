# Copilot Pull Request Description Generation Instructions

## General Guidelines

- Write clear, concise, and informative pull request (PR) descriptions.
- Summarize the purpose and scope of the PR in the opening section.
- List all major changes, new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes.
- Reference related issues by number (e.g., Closes #123) where applicable.
- Use bullet points for clarity when listing changes or steps.
- Include setup or migration steps if required for reviewers or deployers.
- Note any new or removed dependencies and reference the relevant docs in `/docs`.
- Highlight any security, accessibility, or performance considerations.
- If the PR introduces user-facing changes, include screenshots or demo links if possible.

## Structure

1. **Summary**: Briefly describe what the PR does and why.
2. **Changes**: List all major changes, grouped by type (feature, fix, refactor, etc.).
3. **Related Issues**: Reference any issues closed or addressed.
4. **Setup/Migration**: Note any required steps for setup, migration, or deployment.
5. **Dependencies**: List new/removed dependencies and reference `/docs/<package>-integration.md` as needed.
6. **Screenshots/Demos**: (If applicable) Add images or links to demonstrate changes.
7. **Checklist**: Confirm tests, docs, and accessibility checks are complete.

## Style & Best Practices

- Use inclusive, respectful, and clear language.
- Avoid jargon or abbreviations unless well-known in the project.
- Keep descriptions up to date as the PR evolves.
- Use markdown formatting for readability.

## Security & Privacy

- Never include sensitive information in PR descriptions.
- Document any security-relevant changes or new secrets required.
