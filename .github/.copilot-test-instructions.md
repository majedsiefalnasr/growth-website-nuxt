# Copilot Test Generation Instructions

## General Guidelines

- Write clear, maintainable, and idiomatic tests that match the project's style and conventions.
- Use the testing framework and patterns described in `BRIEF.md` and `README.md`.
- Place all tests in the `/tests` directory, mirroring the main app structure.
- For each function or component, include:
  - At least 1 test for expected/typical use
  - At least 1 edge case
  - At least 1 failure case
- Use descriptive test names and group related tests with `describe` blocks (or equivalent).
- Prefer explicit assertions over implicit ones.
- Mock external dependencies and side effects as needed.
- Use type hints and docstrings in test helpers.

## Style & Structure

- Follow the project's naming conventions for test files and functions.
- Keep test files under 500 lines; split into modules if needed.
- Avoid commented-out or dead code in tests.
- Add inline comments for non-obvious logic, especially for complex edge/failure cases.
- Use f-strings for string formatting in test code (if using Python).

## Documentation & Updates

- Update `README.md` if test setup or conventions change.
- Reference this file in PRs when discussing test coverage or conventions.

## Accessibility & Inclusivity

- Ensure tests for user-facing features include accessibility checks (e.g., ARIA, keyboard navigation) where applicable.
- Use inclusive, clear language in test descriptions and comments.

## Security

- Never include secrets or sensitive data in test code or fixtures.
- Use environment variables or secure mocks for any required credentials.
