# Example Test Structure

This directory should mirror the main app structure. Place your test files in subdirectories matching the structure of `app/` and `server/`.

Example:

- tests/app/components/
- tests/app/pages/
- tests/server/

Each test file should include:

- 1 test for expected use
- 1 edge case
- 1 failure case

Refer to `copilot-instructions.md` for more details.
